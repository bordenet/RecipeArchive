# Browser Extension PRD

## Product Overview
The Recipe Archive Browser Extension provides a seamless way for users to capture and save recipes from any website directly to their personal recipe archive.

## User Experience Requirements

### Authentication Flow
This is a **signed-in experience** with strict authentication requirements:

#### Initial User Experience
- **First Launch**: Users must see only a "Sign In" button with no other options available
- **Authentication Required**: No recipe capture functionality is accessible without authentication
- **Clear Call-to-Action**: The sign-in button should be prominent and clearly labeled

#### Post-Authentication Interface
Once authenticated, the popup interface should display:

1. **User Identity**: Clear indication of the signed-in user (email or name)
2. **Primary Action**: Large, prominent "Capture Recipe" button as the main interface element
3. **Secondary Actions**: Minimal "Sign Out" button or link for credential management
4. **Clean Design**: Focused interface dedicated primarily to recipe capture

#### Error Handling
- **Popup-Contained Errors**: All error messages and notifications display within the popup window
- **Scrollable Interface**: The popup becomes scrollable when content (including errors) exceeds the viewport
- **Clear Error States**: Authentication failures, capture errors, and network issues are clearly communicated
- **Recovery Actions**: Users can easily retry failed operations or re-authenticate

### Functional Requirements

#### Recipe Capture
- **One-Click Capture**: Single button press to extract and save recipe data
- **Smart Extraction**: Automatic detection of recipe elements (title, ingredients, instructions, etc.)
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate confirmation of successful captures
- **Error Recovery**: Clear messaging and retry options for failed captures

#### Cross-Browser Support
- **Chrome Extension**: Full feature parity with Manifest V3 compliance
- **Safari Extension**: Native Safari extension with equivalent functionality
- **Consistent UX**: Identical user experience across both browsers

#### Development Experience
- **Development Mode**: Bypass authentication for local development
- **Local Server Integration**: Connect to localhost backend for testing
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication
- **AWS Cognito Integration**: Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure storage
- **Session Persistence**: Maintain authentication across browser sessions

### Data Flow
1. User authenticates through Cognito
2. Extension receives and stores JWT tokens
3. Recipe capture extracts data from current webpage
4. Authenticated API call saves recipe to backend
5. User receives confirmation of successful save

### Security
- **Token Security**: Secure storage of authentication tokens
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications over HTTPS
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks

### Performance
- **Fast Capture**: Recipe extraction and save completes within 3 seconds
- **Minimal Footprint**: Extension has minimal impact on browser performance
- **Offline Resilience**: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues

## Success Metrics
- **Authentication Success Rate**: >95% successful sign-ins
- **Capture Success Rate**: >90% successful recipe captures
- **User Retention**: Users continue using extension after initial setup
- **Error Recovery**: Users successfully recover from error states

## Browser-Specific Notes
