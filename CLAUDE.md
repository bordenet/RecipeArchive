## Project Overview

**RecipeArchive** is a cross-platform recipe archiving system that captures, stores, and syncs culinary discoveries across all devices.

**Problem**: Home cooks lose access to recipes due to paywalls, site changes, ads, or site disappearance.

**Solution**: One-click permanent capture of any online recipe in a clean, ad-free format that syncs everywhere and works offline.

### Platform Architecture

- üîå **Browser Extensions** (Chrome & Safari, JavaScript) - One-click recipe extraction
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Backend** (Go, serverless) - Scalable, cost-effective cloud infrastructure
- üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools** (Go CLI) - Unified development workflow
- üì± **iOS Mobile App** (Swift) - Recipe browsing and capture (planned)
- üåê **Web Application** (React + TypeScript) - Meal planning interface (planned)

## üìã Product Requirements & Architecture

### üéØ PRD Governance

**CRITICAL**: All development work must strictly adhere to the PRDs included in this project. PRDs are the authoritative requirements specification and serve as the definitive guide for all development decisions.

**Development Principle**: Every feature, design decision, and implementation must align with what is explicitly stated in the PRDs. When in doubt, consult the PRDs first. PRDs define the "WHAT" - the requirements, user experience, and functional specifications that must be followed.

**PRD Attribution**: All PRD files include proper attribution to the Product Requirements Assistant at https://github.com/bordenet/product-requirements-assistant

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions (RESOLVED)

**Authentication**: AWS Cognito from Day 1 across all platforms ‚úÖ  
**Recipe Data Model**: Unified TypeScript interface with 15 core fields ‚úÖ  
**Search Features**: Recipe library search (not external discovery) ‚úÖ

### Key Technical Solutions

#### Web Extension Async Fix
```javascript
// Fixed Chrome/Safari content scripts with proper async handling
(async () => {
  try {
    const recipeData = await extractRecipeFromPage();
    const response = { status: "success", data: recipeData };
    setTimeout(() => sendResponse(response), 0);
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
})();
```

#### Authentication Unification
```go
// Report tool now uses same JWT extraction as extensions
func (r *RecipeReporter) extractUserFromJWT(token string) (string, string, error) {
  parts := strings.Split(token, ".")
  payload, err := base64.RawURLEncoding.DecodeString(parts[1])
  // Extract sub (user ID) from JWT payload
}
```

### Recipe Data Model
```typescript
interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  ingredients: IngredientSection[];
  steps: StepSection[];
  servingSize: string;
  prepTime: string;
  cookTime: string;
  photos: string[];
  attributionUrl: string;
  fullPageArchive: string;
  fullTextContent: string; // Complete page text for LLM analysis
  extractedAt: Date;
  userAgent: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Development Workflow & Quality Standards

### Production Quality Standards
- ‚úÖ Monorepo validation (8-tier quality gates)
- ‚úÖ Security scanning (TruffleHog - zero secrets detected)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (no hardcoded paths)
- ‚úÖ AWS Lambda deployed and functional
- ‚úÖ Extension-to-S3 pipeline working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ESLint (1 warning - non-blocking)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: README.md and CLAUDE.md current and comprehensive

### Development Principles
- **Timeout Protection**: All async operations have timeouts to prevent hanging
- **DOM Optimization**: Cache elements, minimize repeated queries
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms
- **Code Quality**: Proactive duplicate/conflict detection
- **Repository Cleanliness**: Regular cleanup of unnecessary files
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular CLAUDE.md review and consolidation to keep project guide concise

### üìã CLAUDE.md Maintenance Rule

**COMMIT RULE**: Every commit triggers an automated CLAUDE.md review to identify pruning and consolidation opportunities.

**Automated Review Process**:
- **Script**: `scripts/review-claude-md.js` runs on every commit via pre-commit hook
- **Checks**: File length, section count, outdated content, duplicate mentions, verbosity
- **Output**: Advisory suggestions for maintaining a concise project guide
- **Goal**: Keep CLAUDE.md under 400 lines with focused, current content

**Review Command**:
```bash
npm run docs:review  # Manual CLAUDE.md review
```

**Common Consolidation Actions**:
- Archive completed features to reduce redundancy
- Merge related sections for better organization  
- Remove outdated status updates and TODOs
- Keep essential context, prune verbose explanations
- Consolidate repeated mentions of key topics (Authentication, Safari Extension, etc.)

This ensures CLAUDE.md remains a focused, actionable project guide rather than an overwhelming historical document.

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT: PII & SECRETS PROTECTION

**ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO LEAK:**
- ‚ùå Personally Identifiable Information (PII): emails, names, phone numbers
- ‚ùå Account credentials: passwords, API keys, tokens
- ‚ùå AWS account IDs, resource ARNs
- ‚ùå Browser cookies, session data
- ‚ùå Any sensitive user or system information

### üîí Security Standards

**MANDATORY PRACTICES:**
1. **Environment Variables**: ALL sensitive data MUST use `.env` files (never committed)
2. **Template Pattern**: Use `.env.template` with placeholder values for documentation
3. **Automated Scanning**: PII/secrets scanning runs on every commit (pre-commit hook)
4. **Code Reviews**: Manual verification that no secrets are hardcoded
5. **Git History**: If PII is accidentally committed, immediately force-push removal

### üõ°Ô∏è Automated Security Scanning

**Pre-commit Hook Configuration:**
- **Tool**: TruffleHog v3 (industry-standard secrets detection)
- **Trigger**: Every git commit automatically scanned
- **Result**: Commit blocked if ANY secrets/PII detected
- **Coverage**: Scans all file types, detects 700+ secret patterns

**Security Gate Commands:**
```bash
# Manual security scan
npm run security:scan

# Pre-commit hook (automatically runs)
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --only-verified

# Emergency PII cleanup
npm run security:clean
```

### üö´ Zero Tolerance Policy

**If PII/secrets are detected:**
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP**: Do not proceed with any commits
2. **Clean Repository**: Remove ALL sensitive data immediately  
3. **Environment Variables**: Replace with proper `.env` pattern
4. **Force Push**: Rewrite git history if already committed
5. **Verify**: Run full repository scan before proceeding

**Example Violations:**
```javascript
// ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
const email = "user@example.com";
const password = "mypassword123";
const awsAccountId = "123456789012";

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THIS  
const email = process.env.USER_EMAIL;
const password = process.env.USER_PASSWORD;
const awsAccountId = process.env.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID;
```

### üìÅ Secure File Patterns

**Template Structure:**
```bash
# .env.template (committed - safe placeholders)
USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# .env (local only - real values, NEVER committed)
USER_EMAIL=actual@email.com
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=990537043943
API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef
```

This security standard is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and applies to all future development work.

### Development Commands

#### Monorepo Validation (Primary Command)
```bash
./validate-monorepo.sh            # Comprehensive validation of entire monorepo
```
**Run this script periodically** (daily/before commits) to ensure monorepo health across all four areas:
- üîå Web Extensions (Chrome & Safari)  
- üß© Recipe Parsers (site-specific parsers)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Backend (Go services)  
- üåê Frontend Clients (coming soon)

#### Essential Development Commands
```bash
# Comprehensive validation (primary command)
./validate-monorepo.sh            # 8-tier quality gates across entire system

# Individual components
npm run lint                       # ESLint for web extensions
npm run test:go                    # Go backend tests
npm run security:scan              # TruffleHog security scanning

# AWS deployment (when needed)
cd aws-backend/functions/recipes
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bootstrap main.go
zip deployment.zip bootstrap
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name RecipeArchive-dev-RecipesFunction16AA7634-Jo1qXv3AOj5w --zip-file fileb://deployment.zip --region us-west-2
```

## Future Development Roadmap

### Next Phase: User Experience Enhancement
1. **iOS Native App**: Swift-based mobile application with offline support
2. **Web Application**: React + TypeScript recipe management interface
3. **Extension Store Submission**: Chrome Web Store and Safari Extensions gallery

### Future Enhancements
1. **Additional Recipe Sites**: Food & Wine, Damn Delicious expansion
2. **Advanced Features**: Meal planning, shopping list generation
3. **Social Features**: Recipe sharing and community collections

## üìù Development Notes

**Current System Status**: All core components are production-ready and deployed. The recipe archiving system successfully captures recipes from 10 supported websites through browser extensions, processes them with TypeScript parsers, and stores them in AWS S3 through Lambda functions with AWS Cognito authentication.

**For Future Development**: Focus areas include iOS app development, web application interface, and additional recipe site support. The current architecture provides a solid foundation for these enhancements.

*This document serves as the primary context for understanding the RecipeArchive project's current state and architecture.*
