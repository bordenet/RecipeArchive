## Project Overview

**RecipeArchive** is a cross-platform recipe archiving system that captures, stores, and syncs culinary discoveries across all devices.

**Problem**: Home cooks lose access to recipes due to paywalls, site changes, ads, or site disappearance.

**Solution**: One-click permanent capture of any online recipe in a clean, ad-free format that syncs everywhere and works offline.

### Platform Architecture

- 🔌 **Browser Extensions** (Chrome & Safari, JavaScript) - One-click recipe extraction
- ☁️ **AWS Backend** (Go, serverless) - Scalable, cost-effective cloud infrastructure  
- 🛠️ **Development Tools** (Go CLI) - Unified development workflow
- 📱 **iOS Mobile App** (Swift) - Recipe browsing and capture (planned)
- 🌐 **Web Application** (React + TypeScript) - Meal planning interface (planned)

### Key Technical Solutions

#### Web Extension Async Fix
```javascript
// Fixed Chrome/Safari content scripts with proper async handling
(async () => {
  try {
    const recipeData = await extractRecipeFromPage();
    const response = { status: "success", data: recipeData };
    setTimeout(() => sendResponse(response), 0);
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling...
  }
})();
```

#### Authentication Unification
```go
// Report tool now uses same JWT extraction as extensions
func (r *RecipeReporter) extractUserFromJWT(token string) (string, string, error) {
  parts := strings.Split(token, ".")
  payload, err := base64.RawURLEncoding.DecodeString(parts[1])
  // Extract sub (user ID) from JWT payload
}
```

### Recipe Data Model
```typescript
interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  ingredients: IngredientSection[];
  steps: StepSection[];
  servingSize: string;
  prepTime: string;
  cookTime: string;
  photos: string[];
  attributionUrl: string;
  fullPageArchive: string;
  fullTextContent: string; // Complete page text for LLM analysis
  extractedAt: Date;
  userAgent: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Development Workflow & Quality Standards

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ ESLint clean (0 errors)  
- ✅ Cross-references validated
- ✅ No duplicate files or variables
- ✅ Proactive issue detection
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md Review**: Automated review for pruning/consolidation opportunities
- 🚨 **PII/Secrets scan (CRITICAL)**: Zero tolerance for PII/credentials in source

### Development Principles
- **Timeout Protection**: All async operations have timeouts to prevent hanging
- **DOM Optimization**: Cache elements, minimize repeated queries
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms
- **Code Quality**: Proactive duplicate/conflict detection
- **Repository Cleanliness**: Regular cleanup of unnecessary files
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Regular CLAUDE.md review and consolidation to keep project guide concise

### 📋 CLAUDE.md Maintenance Rule

**COMMIT RULE**: Every commit triggers an automated CLAUDE.md review to identify pruning and consolidation opportunities.

**Automated Review Process**:
- **Script**: `scripts/review-claude-md.js` runs on every commit via pre-commit hook
- **Checks**: File length, section count, outdated content, duplicate mentions, verbosity
- **Output**: Advisory suggestions for maintaining a concise project guide
- **Goal**: Keep CLAUDE.md under 400 lines with focused, current content

**Review Command**:
```bash
npm run docs:review  # Manual CLAUDE.md review
```

**Common Consolidation Actions**:
- Archive completed features to reduce redundancy
- Merge related sections for better organization  
- Remove outdated status updates and TODOs
- Keep essential context, prune verbose explanations
- Consolidate repeated mentions of key topics (Authentication, Safari Extension, etc.)

This ensures CLAUDE.md remains a focused, actionable project guide rather than an overwhelming historical document.

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT: PII & SECRETS PROTECTION

**ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE TO LEAK:**
- ❌ Personally Identifiable Information (PII): emails, names, phone numbers
- ❌ Account credentials: passwords, API keys, tokens
- ❌ AWS account IDs, resource ARNs
- ❌ Browser cookies, session data
- ❌ Any sensitive user or system information

### 🔒 Security Standards

**MANDATORY PRACTICES:**
1. **Environment Variables**: ALL sensitive data MUST use `.env` files (never committed)
2. **Template Pattern**: Use `.env.template` with placeholder values for documentation
3. **Automated Scanning**: PII/secrets scanning runs on every commit (pre-commit hook)
4. **Code Reviews**: Manual verification that no secrets are hardcoded
5. **Git History**: If PII is accidentally committed, immediately force-push removal

### 🛡️ Automated Security Scanning

**Pre-commit Hook Configuration:**
- **Tool**: TruffleHog v3 (industry-standard secrets detection)
- **Trigger**: Every git commit automatically scanned
- **Result**: Commit blocked if ANY secrets/PII detected
- **Coverage**: Scans all file types, detects 700+ secret patterns

**Security Gate Commands:**
```bash
# Manual security scan
npm run security:scan

# Pre-commit hook (automatically runs)
trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --only-verified

# Emergency PII cleanup
npm run security:clean
```

### 🚫 Zero Tolerance Policy

**If PII/secrets are detected:**
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP**: Do not proceed with any commits
2. **Clean Repository**: Remove ALL sensitive data immediately  
3. **Environment Variables**: Replace with proper `.env` pattern
4. **Force Push**: Rewrite git history if already committed
5. **Verify**: Run full repository scan before proceeding

**Example Violations:**
```javascript
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
const email = "user@example.com";
const password = "mypassword123";
const awsAccountId = "123456789012";

// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS  
const email = process.env.USER_EMAIL;
const password = process.env.USER_PASSWORD;
const awsAccountId = process.env.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID;
```

### 📁 Secure File Patterns

**Template Structure:**
```bash
# .env.template (committed - safe placeholders)
USER_EMAIL=user@example.com
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012
API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# .env (local only - real values, NEVER committed)
USER_EMAIL=actual@email.com
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=990537043943
API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef
```

This security standard is **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and applies to all future development work.

### Development Commands

#### Monorepo Validation (Primary Command)
```bash
./validate-monorepo.sh            # Comprehensive validation of entire monorepo
```
**Run this script periodically** (daily/before commits) to ensure monorepo health across all four areas:
- 🔌 Web Extensions (Chrome & Safari)  
- 🧩 Recipe Parsers (site-specific parsers)
- ☁️ AWS Backend (Go services)  
- 🌐 Frontend Clients (coming soon)

#### Go CLI Commands
```bash
# Project Setup
recipe-cli setup                   # One-time project initialization

# Development Workflow  
recipe-cli dev start               # Start complete development environment
recipe-cli dev stop                # Stop all development services

# Testing
recipe-cli test run                # Run complete test suite
recipe-cli test unit               # JavaScript unit tests only
recipe-cli test go                 # Go backend tests only

# Deployment
recipe-cli deploy aws              # Deploy to AWS Lambda + API Gateway
```

## Next Development Priorities

### IMMEDIATE (Blocking)
1. **Fix Web Extension Linting**: Resolve ESLint errors preventing monorepo validation

### Short Term  
1. **Recipe Extraction Enhancement**: Support additional recipe sites
2. **Extension Store Submission**: Chrome Web Store and Safari Extensions
3. **Remove Playwright Infrastructure**: 2000+ lines, 26MB dependencies, minimal value

### Medium Term
1. **Web Application**: React-based recipe management interface
2. **iOS App Development**: Native mobile experience using existing authentication

### Long Term
1. **Advanced Features**: Meal planning, shopping lists
2. **Social Features**: Recipe sharing and collections
3. **ML Enhancement**: Recipe categorization and recommendations

## Critical Context for Future Development

### Authentication Architecture
- Uses AWS Cognito User Pool: `us-west-2_qJ1i9RhxD`
- JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- Cross-browser storage compatibility (extension API + localStorage fallback)
- Emergency development bypass for testing

### Code Quality Standards
- All DOM queries cached at initialization
- Timeout protection for all async operations (3-10 seconds)
- Comprehensive error logging and fallback mechanisms
- Proactive duplicate detection before user encounters issues

### Repository Structure
- Monorepo with clean separation of concerns
- No duplicate files or conflicting variables
- Essential documentation only (removed 77+ unnecessary files)
- Focused on production-ready code vs development artifacts

### Known Working Patterns
- Real Cognito authentication with JWT tokens (Chrome & Safari)
- ✅ **NEW** TypeScript parser system with decoupled site-specific parsers
- Recipe extraction from JSON-LD fallback and site-specific parsers (Smitten Kitchen, Food Network, NYT Cooking)
- Data transformation for AWS backend (`transformRecipeDataForAWS`)
- S3-based JSON storage architecture (95% cost savings vs DynamoDB)
- Content script messaging (no more complex script injection)

### Critical Architecture Decisions
- **S3-Only Storage**: Never use DynamoDB (cost and complexity)
- **Failed-Parse API**: Planned fallback for extraction failures
- **Security**: No PII/secrets in code, environment variables only

# 🏁 Remaining Work for Full Web Extension Support

To achieve full, reliable support for all listed sites in both Chrome and Safari extensions, the following work remains:

1. **Parser Refinement:**
   - Update and iterate on all site parsers (Food Network, Food52, Epicurious, AllRecipes, Love & Lemons, Alexandra's Kitchen, NYT Cooking, Smitten Kitchen) until every test URL passes strict contract validation.
   - Expand fallback logic and selectors for sites with inconsistent HTML or missing JSON-LD.
   - Add diagnostic logging for edge cases and failures.

2. **Validator Workflow:**
   - Rerun the monorepo-wide validator after each parser update.
   - Block release until all test URLs pass for every site.

3. **Web Extension Integration:**
   - Ensure both Chrome and Safari extensions use the latest, validated TypeScript parser bundle.
   - Test extensions against all supported sites and URLs for real-world coverage.
   - Fix any extension-specific issues (content script messaging, parser loading, etc.).

4. **Documentation & Release:**
   - Update README.md and CLAUDE.md to reflect full site support and validation workflow.
   - Push all changes to GitHub after validation and linting.

5. **Final Validation:**
   - Confirm all parsers and extensions work for every test URL and site.
   - Mark project as fully supporting all listed sites.
