# RecipeArchive AWS Backend Testing

## Overview

This directory contains the AWS backend implementation for RecipeArchive, including comprehensive testing tools and CRUD validation utilities. The backend is designed to support the requirements outlined in the [AWS Backend PRD](../docs/requirements/aws-backend.md).

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core CRUD Operations
- **CREATE**: Create new recipes with validation
- **READ**: Retrieve single recipes or paginated lists
- **UPDATE**: Complete recipe overwrite (per requirement)
- **DELETE**: Soft delete with `isDeleted` flag

### âœ… URL-Based Overwrite Behavior
- **Key Requirement**: "If a recipe exists (primary key: web url) and a user re-loads it from the web extension, the API behavior will be to simply overwrite the existing record"
- **Implementation**: Complete recipe replacement while preserving creation timestamp and incrementing version
- **User Isolation**: Different users can have recipes with same source URL

### âœ… Test Data & Tooling
- **Synthetic Test Recipes**: 5 comprehensive test recipes covering various cuisines and complexity
- **CRUD Validation**: Automated testing of all database operations
- **S3 Cleanup**: Tools to prevent test data accumulation
- **URL Overwrite Testing**: Specific validation of the overwrite requirement

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- DynamoDB table created (default: `RecipeArchive-Recipes-Dev`)
- S3 bucket created (default: `recipe-archive-dev`)

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Show available commands
make help

# Run complete test suite
make test-all

# Load test data only
make load-test-data

# Validate CRUD operations
make validate-crud

# Test URL-based overwrite behavior
make test-url-overwrite

# List current recipes

# Clean up test data
make cleanup-all
```

## Test Data

The test suite includes 5 comprehensive recipes:

1. **Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies** - Classic baking recipe with precise measurements
2. **Classic Margherita Pizza** - Simple ingredients, multiple cooking steps
3. **Grandma's Chicken Noodle Soup** - Complex recipe with long cook times
4. **Vegan Buddha Bowl** - Plant-based recipe with multiple components
5. **Quick 5-Minute Hummus** - Simple recipe with minimal ingredients

Each test recipe includes:
- Structured ingredients with amounts, units, and names
- Step-by-step instructions
- Timing information (prep, cook, total)
- Source URLs and metadata
- Different users for testing isolation

## CRUD Operations Testing

### Create Recipe
```bash
POST /v1/recipes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Test Recipe",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "text": "1 cup flour",
      "amount": 1,
      "unit": "cup", 
      "ingredient": "flour"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "stepNumber": 1,
      "text": "Mix ingredients"
    }
  ],
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/recipe"
}
```

### Read Recipe
```bash
GET /v1/recipes/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}
```

### Update Recipe (Complete Overwrite)
```bash
PUT /v1/recipes/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated Recipe Title",
  "ingredients": [...],
  "instructions": [...],
  "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/recipe"
}
```

### Delete Recipe (Soft Delete)
```bash
DELETE /v1/recipes/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}
```

### Create Backup
```bash
POST /v1/backup/create
Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}
Content-Type: application/json

Response:
{
  "backupId": "backup_user-123_1693564800",
  "downloadUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/backups/user-123/backup.zip?signed=...",
  "expiresAt": "2025-08-27T12:00:00Z",
  "recipeCount": 25,
  "sizeBytes": 156784
}
```

### List Backups
```bash
GET /v1/backup/list
Authorization: Bearer {jwt-token}

Response:
{
  "backups": [
    {
      "backupId": "backup_user-123_1693564800",
      "createdAt": "2025-08-26T12:00:00Z",
      "sizeBytes": 156784,
      "available": true
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

## Backup System

### Purpose
The backup system provides data protection and risk mitigation for:
- **Schema Changes**: Preserve data during database migrations
- **Bug Recovery**: Restore recipes if application bugs cause data loss
- **User Peace of Mind**: Allow users to download their complete recipe collection

### Backup Contents
Each backup zip file contains:
- **backup-manifest.json**: Metadata about the backup (ID, timestamp, recipe count)
- **recipes/**: Individual JSON files for each recipe with structured data
- **README.md**: Human-readable instructions for restoration

### File Structure
```
backup_user-123_1693564800.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ backup-manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ recipes/
    â”œâ”€â”€ recipe-001-chocolate-chip-cookies.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ recipe-002-margherita-pizza.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Storage Location
```
s3://recipe-archive-bucket/
â””â”€â”€ backups/
    â””â”€â”€ {userId}/
        â”œâ”€â”€ backup_user-123_1693564800.zip
        â””â”€â”€ backup_user-123_1693478400.zip
```

### Security & Access
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own backups
- **Time-Limited URLs**: Download URLs expire after 24 hours
- **JWT Authentication**: All backup endpoints require valid authentication

## URL Overwrite Testing

The AWS backend implements a specific requirement: when a user re-extracts a recipe from the same URL via the web extension, the system overwrites the existing record completely.

### Test Scenario
1. Create recipe with basic data
2. "Re-extract" same recipe with completely different data
3. Verify complete overwrite occurred
4. Confirm creation timestamp preserved
5. Confirm version incremented

```bash
make test-url-overwrite
```

## S3 Cleanup & Management

### Automated S3 Cleanup
```bash
# Clean all S3 objects (DESTRUCTIVE)
make cleanup-s3

# Build S3 manager tool
cd functions/s3-manager && go build -o s3-manager main.go

# Clean specific user's objects
./s3-manager -action=cleanup-user -bucket=recipe-archive-dev -user-id=test-user-001

# List all S3 objects
./s3-manager -action=list-objects -bucket=recipe-archive-dev

# Create test objects for development
./s3-manager -action=create-test-objects -bucket=recipe-archive-dev
```

## Environment Configuration

### ðŸ”’ Secure Environment Setup

**CRITICAL SECURITY**: This project uses environment variables to protect sensitive credentials. Never commit actual credentials to the GitHub repository.

#### 1. Environment File Setup
```bash
# Copy the template to create your secure environment file
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env with your actual credentials (this file is in .gitignore)
# NEVER commit the actual .env file to version control
```

#### 2. Required Environment Variables
```bash
# AWS Cognito Test User Credentials (for end-to-end testing)
TEST_USER_EMAIL="your-test-email@example.com"
TEST_USER_PASSWORD="YourSecurePassword123"

# AWS Configuration
AWS_REGION="us-west-2"
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID="your-cognito-user-pool-id"
COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID="your-cognito-app-client-id"

# S3 Configuration (using actual deployed bucket names)
S3_BUCKET_NAME="recipearchive-storage-dev-990537043943"
S3_TEMP_BUCKET_NAME="recipearchive-temp-dev-990537043943"

# DynamoDB Configuration (deprecated - using S3 storage)
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME="RecipeArchive-Recipes-Dev"

# Local Development
LOCAL_SERVER_PORT="8080"
```

#### 3. Test User Credentials
For end-to-end testing, AWS Cognito test credentials are configured in the `.env` file:
- Email and password are used for authentication testing
- These credentials are **NEVER committed to the repository**
- Use `.env.template` as a reference for setup

#### 4. Loading Environment Variables
```bash
# Load environment variables for testing
source scripts/load-env.sh

# Verify credentials are loaded
echo "Test user: $TEST_USER_EMAIL"
echo "S3 bucket: $S3_BUCKET_NAME"
```

### Makefile Configuration
The Makefile uses these default values for testing:
- `TEST_USER_ID`: test-user-001
- `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME`: RecipeArchive-Recipes-Dev
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: recipe-archive-dev

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
# Reset development environment
make dev-reset

# Show current data status
make status

# Run quick CRUD validation
make quick-test
```

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run full test suite
make test-all

# Clean up any test residue
make cleanup-all
```

## Error Handling & Validation

### Request Validation
- Required fields: `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`, `sourceUrl`
- Field limits: Title max 200 chars, ingredient names required
- Structured validation for amounts and units

### Response Formats
```json
// Success Response
{
  "recipe": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "userId": "cognito-user-id",
    "title": "Recipe Title",
    "ingredients": [...],
    "instructions": [...],
    "createdAt": "2025-08-26T10:30:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-08-26T10:30:00Z",
    "version": 1
  }
}

// Error Response  
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Title is required",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-26T10:30:00Z",
    "requestId": "request-uuid"
  }
}
```

## Performance & Monitoring

### SLA Targets (from PRD)
- **Critical APIs**: <300ms response time (95th percentile)
- **List Operations**: <500ms response time (95th percentile)
- **Heavy Operations**: <2s response time (95th percentile)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Error Rate**: <1% for all operations

### Test Validation
The test suite validates these requirements by:
- Measuring response times for each operation
- Testing concurrent updates (version conflicts)
- Validating error handling and recovery
- Ensuring user isolation and data integrity

## Security

### Authentication
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- User-scoped data access only
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Authorization
- All recipes scoped by `userId` from JWT claims
- Cross-user access prevention
- Soft delete preserves audit trail

## Next Steps

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Deploy CDK stack to AWS
2. **Integration Testing**: Test with actual web extensions
3. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and optimize queries
4. **Search Implementation**: Add recipe search functionality
5. **Photo Upload**: Implement S3 photo upload endpoints
