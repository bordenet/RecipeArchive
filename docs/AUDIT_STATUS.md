## Architecture Status
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome/Safari production ready
- **TypeScript Parsers**: Registry-driven, bundled, contract validated
- **AWS Backend**: Lambda + S3 + Cognito deployed
- **Flutter Web App**: Clean Material Design UI, lint-free, tested
- **Security**: Environment variables only, TruffleHog validated

## Development Guidelines
- Use `./validate-monorepo.sh` to verify all components
- Run Flutter app: `cd recipe_archive_fresh && flutter run -d chrome`
- All parsers in `/parsers/sites/site-registry.ts`
- Contract validation enforces required fields (title, ingredients, instructions)

*This audit preserves context for agent continuity and tracks migration completion.*

## Immediate Actions

## Registry-Driven Architecture & PRD Lock-Step

**All supported sites are now registry-driven, fully migrated, validated, and documented.**

This file is kept in lock-step with the browser extension PRD (`docs/requirements/browser-extension.md`) and the central site registry (`/parsers/sites/site-registry.ts`).

Any future changes to supported sites, parser logic, or test coverage must be reflected in all three locations for context continuity and auditability.

This file is intended to preserve session context and reasoning for continuity if agent context is reset or changed.
