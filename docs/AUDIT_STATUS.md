# Documentation Audit & Context Serialization

**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Agent:** Copilot (pre-GPT-5 mini)

## Summary
- All major documentation files (`README.md`, `END_TO_END_INTEGRATION.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`, `TODO-FAILED-PARSE-API.md`) have been cross-linked for context continuity.
- Redundant environment/setup sections in integration guide replaced with references to dedicated config doc.
- No obsolete or duplicated documentation remains; all context is up to date and accurate.

## Files Changed
- `/docs/END_TO_END_INTEGRATION.md`: Added cross-links, merged redundant sections.
- `/docs/README.md`: Added cross-links block, replaced old 'See also' line.
- `/docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`: Added cross-links block at top.
- `/docs/TODO-FAILED-PARSE-API.md`: Added cross-links block at top.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Commit and push all local documentation changes to GitHub.
- Run full test suite to identify and address any failures caused by recent changes.
- Address any test failures and ensure repo stability.

## Next Steps
1. Commit all local changes.
2. Push to GitHub.
3. Run tests and serialize test results.
4. Fix any failures and document resolutions.
