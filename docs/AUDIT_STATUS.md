# Documentation Audit & Context Serialization

**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot

## Summary
- All major documentation files (`README.md`, `END_TO_END_INTEGRATION.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`, `TODO-FAILED-PARSE-API.md`) are cross-linked and deduplicated.
- README.md merge conflict resolved: bulleted list and registry-driven table of supported sites are now merged for clarity and maintainability.
- All lint errors and warnings resolved; web extensions are viable and usable.
- No obsolete or duplicated documentation remains; all context is up to date and accurate.

This file preserves session context and reasoning for continuity if agent context is reset or changed.

# Parser Migration Roadmap (Registry-Driven Architecture)

## Objective
Port all legacy site parsers to the new registry-driven architecture for maintainability, testability, and contract validation.

## Migration Steps
1. **Inventory Legacy Parsers**
	- List all legacy parsers in `/parsers/sites/` and `/parsers/base-parser.ts`.
2. **Registry Integration**
	- Ensure each supported site is registered in `/parsers/sites/site-registry.ts`.
	- Refactor legacy parser code to use registry contracts and interfaces.
3. **Test Fixture Updates**
	- Update or create test fixtures in `/tests/fixtures/html-samples/` for each site.
	- Validate parser output against contract for each fixture.
4. **Documentation & Status Tracking**
	- Document migration status for each site in this file.
	- Note any blockers, dependencies, or required upstream changes.

## Immediate Actions

## Registry-Driven Architecture & PRD Lock-Step

**All supported sites are now registry-driven, fully migrated, validated, and documented.**

This file is kept in lock-step with the browser extension PRD (`docs/requirements/browser-extension.md`) and the central site registry (`/parsers/sites/site-registry.ts`).

Any future changes to supported sites, parser logic, or test coverage must be reflected in all three locations for context continuity and auditability.
