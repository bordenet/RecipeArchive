# Documentation Audit & Context Serialization

**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Agent:** Copilot (pre-GPT-5 mini)

## Summary
- All major documentation files (`README.md`, `END_TO_END_INTEGRATION.md`, `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`, `TODO-FAILED-PARSE-API.md`) are cross-linked and deduplicated.
- README.md merge conflict resolved: bulleted list and registry-driven table of supported sites are now merged for clarity and maintainability.
- All lint errors and warnings resolved; web extensions are viable and usable.
- No obsolete or duplicated documentation remains; all context is up to date and accurate.

## Files Changed
- `/docs/END_TO_END_INTEGRATION.md`: Cross-links, merged redundant sections.
- `/docs/README.md`: Merge conflict resolved, bulleted list and table merged, cross-links block.
- `/docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md`: Cross-links block at top.
- `/docs/TODO-FAILED-PARSE-API.md`: Cross-links block at top.
- `/extensions/chrome/popup.js`: Lint errors and warnings resolved.
- `/extensions/safari/popup.js`: Lint errors resolved, function boundaries repaired.
- `/extensions/shared/jwt-validator.js`: Lint warning resolved.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Complete merge to main and push to GitHub.
- **Continue parser development:**
    - Port legacy parsers to the new registry-driven TypeScript architecture (see `/parsers/sites/site-registry.ts`).
    - Ensure all supported sites have contract-validated parsers and matching test fixtures in `/tests/fixtures/html-samples/`.
    - Remove or refactor any remaining legacy parser code to use the new architecture and registry-driven test infrastructure.
    - Update documentation and registry as new sites are ported or added.

## Next Steps
1. Stage and commit all resolved changes.
2. Complete merge and push to GitHub.
3. Continue parser development as described above.
