### Future Development Areas
- iOS native app development (Swift)
- Web application interface (React + TypeScript)
- Chrome/Safari extension store submission
- Additional recipe sites (Food & Wine, Damn Delicious)

### Critical Architecture Standards
- **S3-Only Storage**: Never use DynamoDB (cost and complexity)
