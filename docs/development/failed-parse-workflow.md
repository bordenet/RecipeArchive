# Failed Web Extension Parse Workflow Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive workflow for handling failed recipe parsing attempts from browser extensions, routing them through our AWS backend, and presenting actionable information through Flutter/Dart mobile applications.

## Current Architecture Context

Our RecipeArchive system currently supports:
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome & Safari with TypeScript parsers for 11+ recipe sites
- **AWS Backend**: Lambda functions with S3 storage and diagnostic capabilities
- **Mobile Applications**: Flutter web, native iOS/iPad, and Android apps with AWS integration
- **Parser System**: Registry-driven TypeScript parsers with fallback mechanisms

## Problem Statement

When browser extensions encounter recipes from unsupported sites or when parsing fails on supported sites, users receive limited feedback and have no mechanism to:
1. Understand why parsing failed
2. Request parser improvements
3. Manually input recipe data as fallback
4. Track parsing improvement progress

## Proposed Workflow Architecture

### Phase 1: Enhanced Diagnostic Collection (Backend)

**AWS Lambda Enhancement - Diagnostic Processing Function**

Create new Lambda function: `RecipeArchive-dev-DiagnosticProcessor`

**Input Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface FailedParseSubmission {
  userId: string;
  url: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  failureReason: 'unsupported_site' | 'parsing_error' | 'timeout' | 'network_error';
  htmlContent?: string;          // If capturable
  domSnapshot?: string;          // Serialized DOM structure
  parserAttempts: {
    parserId: string;
    errorMessage: string;
    stackTrace?: string;
  }[];
  userAgent: string;
  extensionVersion: string;
  metadata: {
    pageTitle?: string;
    metaTags?: Record<string, string>;
    jsonLdData?: any[];
    detectedRecipeElements?: string[];
  };
}
```

**Processing Logic:**
1. **Validation & Sanitization**: Clean HTML content, validate URLs, sanitize user data
2. **Site Classification**: Determine if site is known but failing vs completely new site
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Extract common recipe indicators (ingredients lists, instruction steps, timing)
4. **Storage**: Save to dedicated S3 bucket `recipearchive-failed-parses-{env}`
5. **Notification**: Send structured data to mobile apps via polling/push

### Phase 2: Mobile App Integration

**Flutter Web App - Failed Parse Dashboard**

New screen: `FailedParsesScreen` accessible from main navigation

**Key Features:**
- **Parse Failure List**: Chronological list of failed parsing attempts
- **Failure Details**: Expandable cards showing URL, site, timestamp, failure reason
- **Manual Recipe Entry**: "Add Manually" button to convert failed parse into manual recipe
- **Report Issue**: Direct feedback mechanism for parser improvement requests

**UI Components:**
```dart
class FailedParseCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final FailedParseModel failedParse;
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          ListTile(
            leading: Icon(Icons.error_outline),
            title: Text(failedParse.siteName),
            subtitle: Text(failedParse.failureReason),
            trailing: Text(timeAgo(failedParse.timestamp)),
          ),
          ButtonBar(
            children: [
              TextButton(
                child: Text('Add Manually'),
                onPressed: () => _convertToManualEntry(),
              ),
              TextButton(
                child: Text('View Details'),
                onPressed: () => _showDetails(),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Native iOS/iPad Integration**

New view controller: `FailedParsesViewController` with:
- **SwiftUI List**: Native iOS design for failed parse entries
- **Detail Modal**: Full-screen detail view with parse attempt information
- **Quick Actions**: Swipe actions for "Add Manually" and "Dismiss"
- **Deep Links**: Support for extension-to-app navigation

**Android Integration**

New Activity: `FailedParsesActivity` with:
- **RecyclerView**: Material Design card layout for failed attempts
- **Bottom Sheet**: Detailed view with expandable sections
- **FAB Integration**: Floating action button for bulk operations

### Phase 3: Manual Recipe Fallback System

**Conversion Workflow:**

When users select "Add Manually" from a failed parse:

1. **Pre-populate Form**: Use extracted metadata to pre-fill recipe form
   - Page title â†’ Recipe title (with cleanup)
   - Meta description â†’ Recipe description
   - Detected ingredients â†’ Pre-filled ingredient fields
   - Detected instructions â†’ Pre-filled instruction steps

2. **Smart Suggestions**: 
   - Suggest cooking times based on detected keywords
   - Recommend servings based on recipe content analysis
   - Auto-populate source URL and site name

3. **Validation**: Apply same validation as manual recipe entry
4. **Storage**: Save as regular recipe with `manualEntry: true` flag

### Phase 4: Parser Improvement Pipeline

**Development Team Workflow:**

**Admin Dashboard (Flutter Web - Admin Mode)**

New admin-only section for parser development:
- **Failed Parse Analytics**: Aggregate statistics by site, failure type, frequency
- **Priority Queue**: Failed parses sorted by user impact and feasibility
- **Development Status**: Track parser development progress
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark multiple failures as "fixed" when parser updated

**Parser Development Integration:**

1. **Automated Testing**: Generate test fixtures from failed parse HTML
2. **Parser Registry Updates**: Semi-automated parser creation from common patterns
3. **Validation Pipeline**: Test new parsers against historical failures
4. **Rollout Tracking**: Monitor success rates after parser deployment

### Phase 5: User Communication & Feedback Loop

**In-App Notifications:**

- **Parse Success**: "Your recipe from [site] has been fixed! ðŸŽ‰"
- **Parser Updates**: "We've improved parsing for [site] - try again"
- **Manual Entry Thank You**: "Thanks for manually adding this recipe"

**User Feedback Collection:**

- **Parser Accuracy Rating**: 5-star system for successful parses
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Text field for user-reported parsing issues
- **Feature Requests**: Structured form for new site requests
