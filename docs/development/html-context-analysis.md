# Full HTML Context Analysis Enhancement

## Overview

As of September 3, 2025, the RecipeArchive system has been enhanced to capture and forward full page HTML to OpenAI for comprehensive recipe analysis, including JSON-LD and microdata extraction.

## Architecture Flow

```
Recipe Page â†’ Extension:
â”œâ”€â”€ TypeScript Parsers extract structured data
â””â”€â”€ document.documentElement.outerHTML captures full HTML
    â†“
Backend (recipes Lambda):
â”œâ”€â”€ Receives structured recipe data
â””â”€â”€ Receives webArchiveHtml field
    â†“
OpenAI Normalizer:
â”œâ”€â”€ Original structured data analysis
â””â”€â”€ Enhanced HTML context analysis
    â”œâ”€â”€ JSON-LD data extraction
    â”œâ”€â”€ Microdata parsing
    â”œâ”€â”€ Additional recipe context
    â””â”€â”€ Missing servings/timing inference
```

## Implementation Details

### Chrome Extension Changes
- **File**: `extensions/chrome/popup.js`
- **Enhancement**: Captures `document.documentElement.outerHTML` before sending to AWS
- **Field**: Sent as `webArchiveHtml` field in recipe payload
- **User Feedback**: Shows "ðŸ“„ Capturing page content..." status

### Backend Integration
- **Model**: `CreateRecipeRequest` already had `WebArchiveHTML` field 
- **Recipes Lambda**: Forwards HTML to OpenAI via `pageHtml` parameter
- **Content Normalizer**: Enhanced to accept and process HTML context

### OpenAI Prompt Enhancement
- **HTML Truncation**: Limited to 8000 characters to optimize token usage
- **Context Instructions**: Explicit guidance to extract from JSON-LD, microdata
- **Additional Extraction**: Equipment, storage tips, variations, timing details

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Data Extraction**: Access to structured data the parsers missed
2. **Better Servings Inference**: JSON-LD often contains accurate serving counts
3. **Improved Timing Data**: Structured data provides prep/cook times
4. **Richer Context**: Equipment requirements, storage suggestions
5. **Future-Proof**: Handles new structured data formats automatically

## Token Optimization

- HTML content truncated to 8000 characters
- Balances context richness with API cost efficiency
- Preserves most important structured data sections

## Deployment Status

- âœ… **Production Deployed**: September 3, 2025 at 12:30 PM
- âœ… **Lambda Functions**: All normalizer functions updated
- âœ… **Chrome Extension**: Enhanced with HTML capture
- âœ… **Testing Verified**: OpenAI normalizer processes HTML context successfully

## Expected Impact

**New Recipes**: Will have significantly better data quality with proper servings, timing, and enhanced descriptions.

**Legacy Recipes**: Will continue to show "Unknown" until re-ingested, but all new saves will benefit from full HTML context analysis.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Safari Extension**: Similar HTML capture implementation needed
2. **Batch Re-normalization**: Tool to re-process existing recipes with HTML context
3. **Additional Structured Data**: Support for Recipe Card, Yoast SEO formats
