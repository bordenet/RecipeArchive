# AWS Backend PRD - Recipe Archive Cloud Infrastructure

## Overview

The Recipe Archive AWS Backend provides a scalable, secure cloud infrastructure for recipe management, user authentication, and data synchronization across multiple platforms (browser extensions, mobile apps, and web interface).

## Architecture Goals

### Core Infrastructure
- **Serverless-First**: Leverage AWS Lambda for compute, DynamoDB for storage, API Gateway for routing
- **Multi-Environment**: Development, staging, and production environments with proper CI/CD
- **Cost-Optimized**: Pay-per-use model with automatic scaling and resource optimization
- **Security-Focused**: IAM roles, VPC configuration, encryption at rest and in transit

### Performance Requirements
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for recipe operations, <100ms for authentication
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users, 10M+ recipes storage
- **Global Access**: CloudFront CDN for worldwide low-latency access

## Service Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **AWS Cognito User Pool**: User registration, login, password management
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Social Login**: Google, Apple, Facebook integration
- **MFA Support**: Optional two-factor authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling across devices

### 2. Recipe Management API
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete recipes
- **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search, tag-based filtering, dietary restrictions
- **Image Management**: S3 storage for recipe photos with CDN delivery
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation, content moderation
- **Versioning**: Recipe revision history and rollback capabilities

### 3. Data Storage
- **DynamoDB Tables**:
  - `Users`: User profiles, preferences, settings
  - `Recipes`: Recipe data, metadata, relationships
  - `Images`: Photo metadata, S3 references
  - `Sessions`: Active user sessions, device tracking
- **S3 Buckets**: Recipe images, user uploads, static assets
- **ElastiCache**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### 4. Real-time Features
- **WebSocket API**: Live recipe sharing, collaborative editing
- **Push Notifications**: SNS for mobile app notifications
- **Event Streaming**: EventBridge for cross-service communication
- **Activity Feeds**: Real-time updates for followed users
