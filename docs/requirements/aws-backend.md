### 4. File Storage Architecture

**S3 Bucket Structure** - Three dedicated buckets for different purposes:

```
# Primary storage bucket for user data
recipearchive-storage-{environment}-{accountId}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ users/{userId}/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photos/{recipeId}/main.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archives/{recipeId}/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.html (primary)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.pdf (fallback)

# Temporary processing bucket
recipearchive-temp-{environment}-{accountId}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/{userId}/{sessionId}/...  (7-day retention)

# Failed parsing diagnostics bucket (NEW)
recipearchive-failed-parsing-{environment}-{accountId}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ failed-parsing/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}_{domain}_{uuid}.html  (30-day retention, 20MB limit)
```

**Access Control**:

- **Signed URLs**: Pre-signed URLs for secure file access (24-hour expiration)

#### Global Secondary Indexes

1. **recipes-by-created**: `userId` (PK) + `createdAt` (SK) - chronological listing
2. **recipes-by-title**: `userId` (PK) + `title` (SK) - alphabetical search
3. **recipes-search-date**: `userId` (PK) + `createdAt` (SK) - date range filtering

### 6. Multi-device Sync & Conflict Resolution
