## Technology Stack Options

### Development Approach Consideration

**OPTION A: Native Swift iOS App (Original Plan)**
- **Swift/SwiftUI**: Native iOS development with platform-specific optimizations
- **Core Data**: Local storage with CloudKit sync capabilities
- **URLSession**: HTTP client for AWS API integration
- **iOS Platform**: iPhone and iPad optimized with native performance

**OPTION B: Dart/Flutter Cross-Platform (Cross-Platform Strategy) - UNDER EVALUATION**
- **Flutter Mobile**: Single codebase targeting iOS and Android simultaneously
- **Dart Language**: Type-safe development with excellent tooling
- **Cupertino Widgets**: iOS-native look and feel automatically implemented
- **SQLite/Hive**: Local storage with custom sync to AWS backend
- **Platform Channels**: Access to native iOS features when needed

**Technology Decision Status**: Evaluating Option B for significant development advantages:
- **Code Reuse**: Same app codebase for iOS, Android, and web (Flutter Web)
- **Development Velocity**: Single team, shared business logic, unified testing
- **Maintenance**: One codebase to maintain instead of separate iOS/Android projects
- **Feature Parity**: Automatic feature consistency across all platforms
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks learning curve, potential for faster multi-platform delivery

**Cross-Platform Strategy**: If Flutter is selected for the website (Flutter Web), using Flutter for mobile provides maximum code sharing and development efficiency across the entire RecipeArchive platform.
